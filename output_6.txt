Steps Summary:

1) python 6.py
2) python hw3/eval_scramble.py hw3/original.en  unscrambled_eng_sentences

Description:
1) python 6.py
   Runs the script and outputs the unscrambled english translations to a file unscrambled_eng_sentences
   
2) python hw3/eval_scramble.py hw3/original.en  unscrambled_eng_sentences
   Evaluates  how accurately the sentences have been unscrambled.
  

Observations:
The accuracy after  using the scrambled file as input and  using the parameters estimted by IBM Model 2 is as follows

Right	Total	Acc
92	    100	   0.920

For every german sentence we  compare all possible engish sentences, finding  the maximum log probabiity of each sentence, finding the best alignment possible for each german word in  a given german sentence.  But sometimes here  the product if q and t paramerers tend to become zero.
